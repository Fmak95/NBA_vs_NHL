# NBA_vs_NHL
A statistical analysis on why underdogs do better in the NHL than in the NBA.

For a quick primer on what inspired this repo, please watch this youtube <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNlgISa9Giw">video.</a> In summary, all sports can be put on a luck-to-skill spectrum. So, the reason underdogs do better in NHL than in the NBA is because **hockey is a sport that requires more luck than basketball**.

I try to quantify the luck-to-skill breakdown of each sport and quantify the results. That is, hockey is a sport that is made up of X% luck and Y% skill.
